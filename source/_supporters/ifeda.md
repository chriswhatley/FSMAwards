IFEDA, the Independent Fire Engineering & Distributors Association, was founded in 1989, to provide an independent representative body of fire trade companies. IFEDA is completely unaligned to any manufacturer.

IFEDA is also instrumental in promoting the benefits of these quality and professional industry standards to insurance companies, fire authorities, governments departments and other fire trade companies. Leading the way in training IFEDA offers, amongst others, fire extinguisher training courses. IFEDA continues to champion third party accreditation for fire risk assessments and their importance, following the introduction of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005. 

Fire risk assessments is an area often overlooked by businesses, and IFEDA, by assisting members and promoting quality and fire safety is keen to improve the industry standards of fire risk assessments delivered to business owners and industry as a whole.
