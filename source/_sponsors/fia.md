The FIA is the largest fire protection trade association in the UK with 1000+ members. 

We are a not-for-profit organisation and a major provider of fire safety training. 

Our objective is to promote, improve and perfect fire protection methods, devices, services and apparatus. 

We achieve this through the representation of our members, providing technical support, guidance and opportunities for professional advancement through education and appropriate regulation.

We promote and shape legislation and the professional standards of the fire industry through close liaison with government and official bodies, as well as other key stakeholders. 

We also provide funding for research projects in line with our principal objectives.
