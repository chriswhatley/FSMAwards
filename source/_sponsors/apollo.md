Apollo Fire Detectors Ltd specialises in the design and manufacture of high-quality fire detection solutions for commercial and industrial applications. From our base in Havant, near Portsmouth on the UK’s south coast, we have, for over 40 years, designed and built products that save lives and protect property from the risk of fire.

In that time, we have broadened our capability from a straightforward focus on conventional fire detectors to the manufacture of sophisticated analogue addressable detectors and interfaces.

A relentless desire for innovation drives our company’s product development programme; we are continuously exploring new technologies that help us deliver leading-edge fire detection solutions.

Through planned expansions, Apollo has reached a leading global position in the market for professional fire detection. With regional offices in the UK, America, China, Dubai, Germany and India, plus a network of partners and distributors on five continents, we have cemented our place as a world-class fire solutions provider.

We deliver to our customers tailored fire detection solutions, approved to local standards and regulations, wherever they are based in the world. Apollo fire safety products are used in prestigious locations across the globe: The Statue of Liberty, New York; The Royal Albert Hall, London; The Kremlin, Moscow, to name but a few.

Apollo is part of the Halma group of companies. Halma is a FTSE Top 100 listed PLC, with over 40 subsidiaries worldwide; all engaged in specialist engineering activities.
