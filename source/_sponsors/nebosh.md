NEBOSH (The National Examination Board in Occupational Safety and Health) was formed in 1979 as an awarding body with charitable status. We offer a comprehensive range of globally-recognised qualifications designed to meet the health, safety and environmental management needs of all places of work

Courses leading to NEBOSH qualifications attract around 50,000 candidates annually and are offered by over 600 course providers, with exams taken in over 120 countries around the world. In 2014, we were delighted to be awarded Britain's highest accolade for trade success, the Queen's Award for Enterprise, for our "outstanding achievement" in International Trade.
